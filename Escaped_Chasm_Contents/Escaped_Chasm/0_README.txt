To play the game, click on Escaped Chasm. Use the arrow keys to move.
Note: Some movies are likely to freeze the game. If this happens, you'll have to restart the game. I've included a guide to help you check the flags faster in case this happens.
The guide and other goodies are located in the "Extras" folder outside of the main game folder.

::::::::OPENING SUBTITLES:::::::::
(in case this is hard to read/goes by too quickly)

	
	Sometimes... When I close my eyes...
	When I left my mind drift...
	I can feel a world beyond my own.
	It's vast and beautiful.
	...I can see through the eyes of a girl I admire...
	However...
	As my consiousness slips back to me...
	I remember that this euphoric dream is not real...
	As I awaken, my connection to that world slowly fades from my memory.
	...I won't let that world escape me.
	I will hold onto these fragments of my dreams in any way I can.
	Maybe... I can never truly reach that world...
	But maybe one day
	I can still become the girl I see in that place.

::::::::BONUS ROOM CARTOON:::::::::
(in case this is hard to read/goes by too quickly)

	It seems as time has passed,
	She slowly lost hold of her memories from her last life.
	However, she is still drawn to the girl she met in her dream.
	Though, maybe for the wrong reasons.
	Maybe one day she might realize and remember
	The real reason she's drawn to her.
