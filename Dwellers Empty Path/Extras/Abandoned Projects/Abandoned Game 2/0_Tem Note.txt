Tem here!

I got pretty far with this one huh! 
I don't really know why I stopped this one, I probably have nearly enough assets in here for a 
full game! 
But, I guess I explored some of the same themes in Dweller's Empty Path, so there isn't really
a need for this game to exist. 

This game's would've focused on Claire and would've also been made in RPGMaker.
