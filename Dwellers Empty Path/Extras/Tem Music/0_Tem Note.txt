Tem here!

Here's the music I originally made to use in the game before I got stumped. 
I decided to include these in case you were interested in hearing some of my early songs!

I do actually like how a few of these came out, but trying to make a soundtrack for the whole
game got a bit overwhelming for me..
But!! I haven't given up on making music entirely! 
I feel more inspired than ever after hearing Toby and Camellia's arrangements and songs
for the game!
