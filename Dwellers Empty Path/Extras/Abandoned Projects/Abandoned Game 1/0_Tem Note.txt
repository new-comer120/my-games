Tem here!

This was something I started working on because I wanted something to do in my free time.
I was originally going to make this my first RPGMaker project, but I realized after I drew
all these assets..that I didn't draw them in the correct dimensions for RPGMaker. 

I put this project on the backburner for awhile until I could learn RPGMaker more, but ultimately
I just ended up scrapping this project.
